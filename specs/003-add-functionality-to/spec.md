# Feature Specification: Pushbullet Notification Integration for Sync Success/Error

**Feature Branch**: `003-add-functionality-to`  
**Created**: September 23, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "add functionality to this tool so the user can specify a pushbullet API key in the config and if set, on successful run it should send a single push notification via their pushbullet account with a simple success message, e.g. 'Outlook to CalDAV synced successfully, X events created'. if any error occurs, it should send a similar push notification with a single concise message saying it failed with an error, and including the error message."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A user configures their Pushbullet API key in the sync tool's config. When the sync process runs, if successful, the user receives a Pushbullet notification stating the sync succeeded and how many events were created. If the sync fails, the user receives a Pushbullet notification with a concise error message.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid Pushbullet API key is set in config, **When** the sync completes successfully, **Then** a Pushbullet notification is sent with a success message and event count.
2. **Given** a valid Pushbullet API key is set in config, **When** the sync fails with an error, **Then** a Pushbullet notification is sent with a concise error message.
3. **Given** no Pushbullet API key is set in config, **When** the sync runs, **Then** no Pushbullet notification is sent.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the Pushbullet API key is invalid or expired?
- How does the system handle Pushbullet API rate limits or network errors?
- What if the notification fails to send—should the error be logged or retried?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to specify a Pushbullet API key in the configuration.
- **FR-002**: System MUST send a Pushbullet notification with a success message and event count when sync completes successfully and API key is set.
- **FR-003**: System MUST send a Pushbullet notification with a concise error message when sync fails and API key is set.
- **FR-004**: System MUST NOT send any Pushbullet notification if API key is not set in config.
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle and log Pushbullet API errors (e.g., invalid key, network issues).
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure notifications are sent only once per sync run.
- **FR-007**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should notification failures be retried, or only logged?]

### Key Entities
- **Pushbullet API Key**: Represents the user's credential for sending notifications; stored in config.
- **Notification Message**: Represents the content sent to Pushbullet; includes success or error details.
- **Sync Result**: Represents the outcome of the sync process (success with event count, or error message).
